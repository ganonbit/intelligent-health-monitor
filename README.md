# Intelligent Health Monitor

**Production-grade AI-powered system monitoring framework** built with Python 3.13 and Pydantic AI.

## The Problem

Modern monitoring tools excel at data collection but struggle with intelligent analysis:

- Alert fatigue from threshold-based rules
- Manual correlation of related incidents
- Reactive rather than predictive maintenance
- Generic alerts that don't understand system context

## The Solution

Type-safe AI integration with robust system design:

- **Structured AI Analysis**: Pydantic AI ensures reliable, typed responses
- **Protocol-Driven Architecture**: Extensible to any monitoring source
- **Production Patterns**: Circuit breakers, structured concurrency, comprehensive error handling
- **Domain Extensibility**: Framework supports any system type (IoT, infrastructure, industrial)

## Architecture Highlights

- **Modern Python**: 3.13 with advanced async patterns, structured concurrency
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance, protocol-based dependency injection
- **Observability**: Structured logging, performance metrics, error tracking
- **Resilient Design**: Result types, circuit breakers, graceful degradation
- **Testable**: Property-based testing, comprehensive mocking, integration tests

## Quick Start

```bash

uv sync

# Run the example
uv run python core/services/metrics_collector.py
```
